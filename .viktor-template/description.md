This is a VIKTOR app that consists of four different pages, all doing something different with data:

1. CSV to Matplotlib visualization

   In the first page it is possible to upload a CSV file. If you want to use an example CSV file you can
   download one about the properties of different materials. After uploading and selecting a CSV file you
   can plot its data using Matplotlib.

2. Animations with Plotly

   In the 2nd page is shown how easy it is to integrate VIKTOR with other libraries like Plotly. 
   This example is created with just 3 lines of code!

3. Numpy interpolation 

   The third example is used to show how you can create interactive apps using VIKTOR. 
   In this example you can pick samples from a sin function. 
   Then use Numpy to estimate a interpolation with a given polynomial. 
   Finally, you can check the error at a certain x value.

4. Heatmap using pandas

   The last example shows how easy you can do data manipulation using VIKTOR. 
   In this page we use a database that is randomly created with Numpy. Then Pandas is used
   to create a correlation matrix which is used to plot a heatmap.
